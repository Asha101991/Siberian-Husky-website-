    <h2>About Siberian Husky</h2>
    <p>Siberian Husky, a <strong> coated</strong>, compact sled dog of medium size and great endurance, was developed to work in packs, pulling light loads at moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses. Sibes are friendly, <em>fastidious</em>, and dignified. The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky's almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue'and sometimes one of each'and convey a keen but amiable and even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute. As born pack dogs, they enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs. The Sibe's innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. <br>These are energetic dogs who can't resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed: Sibes are naturally clean, with little doggy odor.</p>
    <h3>Health</h3>
    <p>Fortunately, the Siberian Husky is a relatively healthy breed. Responsible breeders screen their breeding stock for health problems such as juvenile cataracts, and the breed's national parent club, the Siberian Husky Club of America, has strict guidelines to help reduce reported cases. Beginning at 12 months of age, all Siberians who potentially will be part of a breeding program should be examined by a canine ophthalmologist. The exam is then repeated on a yearly basis. New screenings and tests are being constantly being developed to help breeders in their selection of a potential dam and sire. Knowledgeable breeding practices ensure the future health of the breed. <br>Owners of working Siberians need to closely monitor each dog to be able to recognize when something just isn't right. Having a veterinarian familiar with working dogs is an advantage.</p>

    <h3>Nutrition</h3>
    <p>Feeding a high-quality dog food is essential for the Siberian's healthy skin and coat. Adjustments in the level of protein in the food is required for the working Siberian, based on the level of activity. In the summer months, a lower protein level may be appropriate, around 20 percent, while a dog working in harness in wintertime may need 32 percent protein. Monitor each individual Siberian, and adjust the amount and type of food as required. Be careful not to overfeed. Monitor the weight of each dog, and be selective about supplements.</p>

    <h2>Grooming</h2>
    <p>Siberian Huskies are considered a 'natural' breed. They are remarkably self-cleaning and often need only a few baths a year, unless being shown in conformation dog shows. Weekly brushings help keep the coat and skin in good condition. Siberians have a double coat'an undercoat, and guard hair. The undercoat is shed twice a year, and it is important to continually 'rake out' the old coat, using a pin brush and metal comb. Pay close attention to the length of the nails, and keep them trimmed to prevent any foot problems. Siberians competing in conformation require a bit more selective grooming for the best presentation.</p>
